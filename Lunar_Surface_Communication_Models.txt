2. TERRESTRIAL-ADAPTED MODELS
================================================================================

2.1 LONGLEY-RICE MODEL (IRREGULAR TERRAIN MODEL - ITM)
-------------------------------------------------------

OVERVIEW:
The Longley-Rice model is a terrestrial propagation model adapted for lunar
use by NASA. It was validated against Apollo mission field data and is well-
suited for predicting radio propagation over irregular terrain.

KEY FEATURES:
- Accounts for terrain-induced path loss deviations
- Uses Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data
- Calculates diffraction losses over obstacles
- Models reflection from irregular surfaces

LUNAR ADAPTATIONS:
- Remove atmospheric absorption components
- Adjust for lunar regolith dielectric properties
- Modify ground conductivity parameters
- Account for vacuum propagation

NASA VALIDATION:
NASA presented the application of an adapted Longley-Rice model for irregular
terrains along with digital elevation data that accurately represent real 
lunar locations. This model was validated with field data collected during 
the Apollo project.

APPLICATIONS:
- Long-range communication planning (>5 km)
- Terrain-limited coverage analysis
- Site selection for base stations
- Rover traverse planning

INPUT PARAMETERS:
- Transmitter location (lat, lon, elevation)
- Receiver location (lat, lon, elevation)
- Frequency (MHz or GHz)
- Antenna heights (meters)
- Terrain profile (from DEM)
- Surface dielectric constant
- Surface conductivity

OUTPUT:
- Path loss (dB)
- Signal strength at receiver
- Propagation mode (line-of-sight, diffraction, scatter)


2.2 FREE-SPACE PATH LOSS MODEL
-------------------------------

OVERVIEW:
The fundamental propagation model assuming ideal conditions with no obstacles
or reflections. This forms the baseline for more complex models.

EQUATION:
FSPL (dB) = 20 * log10(d_km) + 20 * log10(f_MHz) + 32.45

Where:
- d_km = distance between transmitter and receiver (kilometers)
- f_MHz = frequency in MHz

Alternative form:
FSPL (dB) = 20 * log10(d_m) + 20 * log10(f_GHz) + 92.45

LUNAR APPLICABILITY:
This model works well on the Moon for:
- Line-of-sight communications
- Flat terrain (mare regions)
- Initial link budget estimates
- Upper bound on signal strength

ADVANTAGES:
- Simple to calculate
- No terrain data required
- Conservative estimate
- Good for quick analysis

LIMITATIONS:
- Does not account for terrain blocking
- Ignores multipath effects
- Does not model ground reflections
- Over-optimistic in mountainous regions


2.3 FRESNEL ZONE MODEL
-----------------------

OVERVIEW:
Fresnel zones define regions around the direct line-of-sight path where
obstacles can cause significant diffraction and signal degradation.

FRESNEL ZONE RADIUS:
r_n = sqrt(n * λ * d1 * d2 / (d1 + d2))

Where:
- n = Fresnel zone number (typically use n=1)
- λ = wavelength
- d1 = distance from transmitter to obstacle
- d2 = distance from obstacle to receiver

CLEARANCE REQUIREMENTS:
- 100% of 1st Fresnel zone clear: No additional loss
- 60% of 1st Fresnel zone clear: ~3 dB additional loss
- 40% of 1st Fresnel zone clear: ~6 dB additional loss

LUNAR APPLICATION:
On the Moon, Fresnel zone clearance is critical because:
- No atmospheric diffusion to "bend" signals
- Sharp terrain features (no erosion)
- Crater rims and mountain ridges are common obstacles

EXAMPLE:
At 2.4 GHz, over 5 km distance:
- Wavelength λ = 0.125 m
- 1st Fresnel zone radius at midpoint ≈ 6.25 meters
- Antennas should be >6 meters high to clear obstacles


2.4 TWO-RAY GROUND REFLECTION MODEL
------------------------------------

OVERVIEW:
This model accounts for both the direct path and a single ground-reflected
path between transmitter and receiver.

PATH LOSS REGIONS:

Short Range (d < 4 * ht * hr / λ):
Path loss ∝ 1/d² (similar to free space)

Long Range (d > 4 * ht * hr / λ):
Path loss ∝ 1/d⁴ (ground reflection dominates)

EQUATION (Long Range):
PL(dB) = 40 * log10(d) - 20 * log10(ht) - 20 * log10(hr)

Where:
- d = distance (meters)
- ht = transmitter antenna height (meters)
- hr = receiver antenna height (meters)

LUNAR MODIFICATIONS:
- Reflection coefficient depends on regolith properties
- Dielectric constant ε_r ≈ 2.5 - 3.5 (varies with composition)
- Lower conductivity than Earth soil
- Roughness scattering reduces reflection strength

GROUND REFLECTION COEFFICIENT:
For vertical polarization:
Γ = (ε_r * sin(θ) - sqrt(ε_r - cos²(θ))) / 
    (ε_r * sin(θ) + sqrt(ε_r - cos²(θ)))

For horizontal polarization:
Γ = (sin(θ) - sqrt(ε_r - cos²(θ))) / 
    (sin(θ) + sqrt(ε_r - cos²(θ)))

SURFACE ROUGHNESS:
Rayleigh criterion for smooth surface:
h_rms < λ / (8 * sin(θ))

Where:
- h_rms = RMS surface height variation
- θ = grazing angle

Lunar regolith is typically rough at UHF/microwave frequencies.


2.5 DIFFRACTION MODELS
-----------------------

KNIFE-EDGE DIFFRACTION:
When terrain creates a sharp obstacle:

Diffraction loss (dB) = 6.9 + 20 * log10(sqrt((v-0.1)² + 1) + v - 0.1)

Where v is the Fresnel diffraction parameter:
v = h * sqrt(2 * (d1 + d2) / (λ * d1 * d2))

And:
- h = obstacle height above line-of-sight (meters)
- d1, d2 = distances from tx/rx to obstacle
- λ = wavelength

MULTIPLE KNIFE-EDGE:
For multiple obstacles (mountain ranges):
Use Bullington method or Epstein-Peterson approach

ROUNDED OBSTACLE:
For hills and crater rims:
Use Deygout method with effective knife-edge

3. LUNAR-SPECIFIC PROPAGATION MODELS
================================================================================

3.1 LUNAR TERRAIN PROPAGATION MODEL
------------------------------------

OVERVIEW:
This model specifically addresses propagation over the unique lunar terrain,
accounting for craters, mountains, and irregular surface features.

KEY FINDINGS FROM RESEARCH:
- Terrain geometry, signal frequency, antenna location, and lunar surface
  material are important factors determining propagation characteristics
- Path loss can be much more severe than free-space propagation
- Greatly affected by antenna height, operating frequency, and surface material

TERRAIN EFFECTS:

1. Line-of-Sight Blocking:
   - Crater rims block signals
   - Mountains create radio shadows
   - Boulders cause local shadowing
   - No atmospheric diffraction to "bend" around obstacles

2. Grazing Angle Effects:
   - Low antenna heights → shallow grazing angles
   - More terrain interaction
   - Increased multipath
   - Higher path loss

3. Surface Roughness:
   - Regolith micro-roughness causes scattering
   - Reduces specular reflection
   - Frequency-dependent effect
   - Boulder fields increase scattering

CRATER ENVIRONMENT MODEL:
Inside craters, special considerations apply:

- Multiple reflections from crater walls
- Signal delay due to multipath can limit maximum data rate
- Path loss varies significantly with position
- "Sweet spots" exist where reflections constructively interfere

CRATER PATH LOSS FORMULA (Empirical):
PL_crater(dB) = PL_freespace + 10 * n * log10(d/d0) + Χ

Where:
- n = path loss exponent (2 to 4, depending on crater geometry)
- d0 = reference distance (typically 1 meter)
- Χ = shadow fading term (log-normal distribution)

DELAY SPREAD IN CRATERS:
RMS delay spread can reach 10-100 nanoseconds in deep craters
This limits achievable data rates:
Max bitrate ≈ 1 / (10 * τ_rms)


3.2 REGOLITH-SPECIFIC PROPAGATION
----------------------------------

LUNAR REGOLITH PROPERTIES:

Dielectric Constant (ε_r):
- Varies with composition: 2.5 to 4.5
- Typical value: 3.0 at microwave frequencies
- Density-dependent
- Frequency-dependent (slight variation)

Loss Tangent (tan δ):
- Very low: 0.001 to 0.01
- Much lower than wet Earth soil
- Minimal absorption losses

Conductivity (σ):
- Very low: 10⁻⁶ to 10⁻⁸ S/m
- Orders of magnitude lower than Earth
- Affects ground wave propagation

SURFACE ROUGHNESS:
- Small-scale: millimeter to centimeter variations
- Large-scale: meter-scale boulders and ridges
- Apollo measurements: RMS height 1-10 cm (local scale)

IMPLICATIONS FOR PROPAGATION:

1. Ground Wave:
   - Limited due to low conductivity
   - Only effective at very low frequencies (<30 MHz)
   - Not practical for most lunar communications

2. Reflection Coefficient:
   - Moderate reflection (not as strong as Earth)
   - Reduced by surface roughness
   - Polarization-dependent

3. Scattering:
   - Significant at UHF and above
   - Reduces coherent multipath
   - Creates diffuse reflections


3.3 MULTIPATH PROPAGATION MODEL
--------------------------------

LUNAR MULTIPATH CHARACTERISTICS:

Unlike Earth:
- NO moving scatterers (vehicles, trees swaying, etc.)
- NO atmospheric turbulence
- NO ionospheric variations
- NO precipitation

But still has:
- Terrain reflections (static)
- Surface scattering (static)
- Boulder reflections (static)

IMPLICATION:
Multipath on the Moon creates periodic, predictable interference patterns
rather than random fading. Received signal strength is stable but position-
dependent.

POWER DELAY PROFILE:
Typical lunar surface (flat terrain):
- Direct path: 0 dB (reference)
- Ground reflection: -3 to -10 dB, delay 1-100 ns
- Boulder scatter: -10 to -20 dB, delay 10-500 ns

Crater environment:
- Direct path: 0 dB
- Wall reflections: -5 to -15 dB, delay 100-1000 ns
- Multiple bounce: -15 to -25 dB, delay 1-10 μs

RMS DELAY SPREAD:
- Flat terrain: 5-20 ns
- Moderate terrain: 20-50 ns
- Crater/canyon: 50-500 ns

COHERENCE BANDWIDTH:
B_c ≈ 1 / (5 * τ_rms)

Examples:
- Flat terrain (τ_rms = 10 ns): B_c ≈ 20 MHz
- Crater (τ_rms = 100 ns): B_c ≈ 2 MHz

FADE MARGIN:
Since fading is not random/Rayleigh:
- Use deterministic approach
- Calculate specific multipath for geometry
- Add margin for position uncertainty (3-6 dB typical)


3.4 TEMPERATURE EFFECTS
------------------------

LUNAR TEMPERATURE EXTREMES:
- Daytime: +127°C (400 K)
- Nighttime: -173°C (100 K)
- Polar shadowed craters: -233°C (40 K)

EFFECTS ON PROPAGATION:

1. Dielectric Properties:
   - Slight variation with temperature
   - Generally negligible effect on path loss

2. Equipment Performance:
   - Transmitter power varies with temperature
   - Receiver sensitivity changes
   - Antenna impedance shifts
   - Battery performance degraded

3. Thermal Noise:
   - Lower ambient temperature = lower noise floor
   - Nighttime operations have better SNR (if equipment works)
   - Cosmic background noise dominates (2.7 K)

THERMAL NOISE POWER:
N = k * T * B

Where:
- k = Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K)
- T = system noise temperature (K)
- B = bandwidth (Hz)

Lunar surface (daytime): T_sys ≈ 400-600 K
Lunar surface (night, cold sky): T_sys ≈ 100-200 K
Deep space: T_sys ≈ 50-100 K (antenna looking at cold sky)

- Cold lunar surface: 100 K (night)
- Deep space: 2.7 K (cosmic background)

NOISE POWER:
P_noise (dBm) = -174 + 10*log10(B_Hz) + 10*log10(T_sys/290)

================================================================================
7. MODEL PARAMETERS AND EQUATIONS
================================================================================

7.1 COMPREHENSIVE LINK BUDGET
------------------------------

GENERAL FORM:
P_rx = P_tx + G_tx + G_rx - PL_free - PL_terrain - PL_misc + G_multipath

DETAILED BREAKDOWN:

Transmitter Side:
- P_tx (dBm): Transmit power
- G_tx (dBi): Transmit antenna gain
- L_cable_tx (dB): Cable/connector losses (subtract)
- L_pointing_tx (dB): Pointing loss (subtract)

Propagation:
- PL_free (dB): Free space path loss (subtract)
- PL_atm (dB): Atmospheric loss = 0 dB on Moon
- PL_terrain (dB): Terrain/diffraction loss (subtract)
- PL_vegetation (dB): Vegetation loss = 0 dB on Moon
- G_multipath (dB): Multipath gain/loss (can be + or -)

Receiver Side:
- G_rx (dBi): Receive antenna gain
- L_cable_rx (dB): Cable/connector losses (subtract)
- L_pointing_rx (dB): Pointing loss (subtract)
- L_polarization (dB): Polarization mismatch (subtract)

COMPLETE EQUATION:
P_rx (dBm) = P_tx + G_tx - L_cable_tx - L_pointing_tx
             - PL_free - PL_terrain + G_multipath
             + G_rx - L_cable_rx - L_pointing_rx - L_polarization

MARGIN CALCULATION:
Margin (dB) = P_rx - Sensitivity - Margin_implementation

Where:
- Sensitivity = minimum receivable power
- Margin_implementation = additional margin (6-10 dB typical)


7.2 PATH LOSS CALCULATIONS
---------------------------

FREE SPACE PATH LOSS:
FSPL(dB) = 20*log10(d_m) + 20*log10(f_Hz) - 147.55

Alternative forms:
FSPL(dB) = 20*log10(d_km) + 20*log10(f_MHz) + 32.45
FSPL(dB) = 20*log10(d_km) + 20*log10(f_GHz) + 92.45

EXAMPLE:
d = 5 km, f = 2.4 GHz
FSPL = 20*log10(5) + 20*log10(2400) + 32.45
     = 13.98 + 67.60 + 32.45
     = 114.03 dB

TWO-RAY PATH LOSS (long range):
PL(dB) = 40*log10(d) - 10*log10(G_tx * G_rx)

Where gains are linear, not dB.

EMPIRICAL MODEL (lunar surface):
PL(dB) = PL_0 + 10*n*log10(d/d_0) + X_shadow

Where:
- PL_0 = path loss at reference distance d_0
- n = path loss exponent (2 to 5, terrain-dependent)
- X_shadow = shadow fading (log-normal, σ = 4-8 dB)

PATH LOSS EXPONENTS (Lunar):
- Line-of-sight, flat: n = 2.0 to 2.2
- Line-of-sight, rolling: n = 2.2 to 2.7
- Near-LOS, light obstruction: n = 2.7 to 3.5
- Non-LOS, moderate terrain: n = 3.5 to 4.5
- Non-LOS, heavy terrain/crater: n = 4.5 to 6.0


7.3 ANTENNA CONSIDERATIONS
---------------------------

ANTENNA TYPES FOR LUNAR USE:

Omnidirectional:
- Dipole: 2.15 dBi gain
- Monopole (ground plane): 5.15 dBi
- Sleeve dipole: 2-4 dBi
- Quadrifilar helix: 3-5 dBi (circular polarization)

Directional:
- Patch: 6-9 dBi
- Yagi: 8-15 dBi
- Parabolic dish: 15-40 dBi
- Horn: 10-25 dBi

ANTENNA HEIGHT EFFECTS:
Higher antennas provide:
- Better line-of-sight
- Reduced terrain blocking
- Lower grazing angles (less multipath)
- Extended radio horizon

Radio Horizon Distance:
d_horizon = sqrt(2 * R_moon * h)

Where:
- R_moon = 1737.4 km
- h = antenna height (km)

Example:
h = 3 meters = 0.003 km
d_horizon = sqrt(2 * 1737.4 * 0.003) = 3.23 km

GAIN-TO-NOISE-TEMPERATURE (G/T):
G/T = G_rx (dBi) - 10*log10(T_sys)

Better G/T → better receive sensitivity

ANTENNA TEMPERATURES:
- Looking at hot lunar surface: 400 K
- Looking at cold lunar surface: 100 K
- Looking at deep space: 2.7 K
- Typical system: 200-600 K


7.4 NOISE CALCULATIONS
----------------------

SYSTEM NOISE TEMPERATURE:
T_sys = T_rx + T_antenna + T_cable + T_sky

NOISE POWER:
N (dBm) = -174 + 10*log10(B_Hz) + 10*log10(T_sys/290)

Where:
- -174 dBm/Hz is reference at 290 K
- B_Hz is bandwidth in Hz
- T_sys is in Kelvin

EXAMPLE:
Bandwidth = 10 MHz, T_sys = 400 K
N = -174 + 70 + 1.4 = -102.6 dBm

SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO:
SNR (dB) = P_rx (dBm) - N (dBm)

CARRIER-TO-NOISE RATIO:
C/N0 (dB-Hz) = P_rx (dBm) - N0 (dBm/Hz)

Where:
N0 = -174 + 10*log10(T_sys/290)

BIT ERROR RATE:
For coherent BPSK:
BER = 0.5 * erfc(sqrt(Eb/N0))

For non-coherent FSK:
BER = 0.5 * exp(-0.5 * Eb/N0)

Where:
Eb/N0 = (C/N0) - 10*log10(Bitrate)


7.5 DATA RATE AND CAPACITY
---------------------------

SHANNON CAPACITY:
C = B * log2(1 + SNR)

Where:
- C = channel capacity (bits/s)
- B = bandwidth (Hz)
- SNR = signal-to-noise ratio (linear, not dB)

EXAMPLE:
B = 20 MHz, SNR = 20 dB (100 linear)
C = 20e6 * log2(101) = 132.9 Mbps

PRACTICAL DATA RATES:
Due to coding overhead, practical rates are 50-80% of Shannon limit.

MODULATION EFFICIENCY:
- BPSK: 1 bit/s/Hz
- QPSK: 2 bits/s/Hz
- 16-QAM: 4 bits/s/Hz
- 64-QAM: 6 bits/s/Hz
- 256-QAM: 8 bits/s/Hz

Required SNR increases with modulation order.

DELAY-BANDWIDTH PRODUCT:
For channels with delay spread τ:
Maximum bitrate ≈ 1 / (10 * τ)

Example:
τ = 50 ns (crater environment)
Max bitrate ≈ 20 Mbps (before ISI becomes problematic)

EQUATION:
if LOS_check(tx, rx, DEM) == True:
    PL = max(FSPL(d), TwoRay(d, h_tx, h_rx))
    PL_total = PL + margin
else:
    PL_total = FSPL(d) + diffraction_loss + margin

PARAMETERS:
- Frequency: 2.4 GHz (WiFi/LTE band)
- Antenna heights: 1-3 meters
- Terrain: LRO LOLA DEM (resolution: 30-100 m/pixel)

   - Check if ray intersects surface

3. Calculate Free-Space Loss:

4. Calculate Two-Ray Loss:
   If d > critical_distance:
       PL_2ray = 40*log10(d) - 20*log10(h_tx) - 20*log10(h_rx)
   Else:
       PL_2ray = FSPL

5. Select Worst Case:
   PL = max(FSPL, PL_2ray)

6. Add Margin:
   PL_total = PL + 8 dB (typical)

7. Check Link:
   P_rx = P_tx + G_tx + G_rx - PL_total
   if P_rx > Sensitivity:
       Link is viable
